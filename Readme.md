# PoseNet 

Unlike papers, I implemented PoseNet using ResNet, 
and got better results than thesis.

It was a light pet project, so I did not care about dependency 
because I did not think about distribution.

This is my machine's setting.

* Ubuntu 16.04
* Anaconda 4.4.0
* Python 3.6
* Cuda 8.0
* Cudnn 5.1.1
* Pytorch from source
