# PoseNet 

Unlike papers, I implemented PoseNet using ResNet, 
and got better results than thesis.

It is a small pet project, so I did not care about dependency.

This is my machine's setting.

* Ubuntu 16.04
* Anaconda 4.4.0
* Python 3.6
* Cuda 8.0
* Cudnn 5.1.1
* Pytorch from source

If you have any question, just let me know.
